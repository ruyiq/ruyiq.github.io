- ### [Power BI Portfolio](https://github.com/ruyiq/powere-bi-portfolio.git))

## Machine Learning: Computer Vision 
- ### [VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection](https://github.com/ruyiq/VinBigData-Chest-X-ray-Abnormalities-Detection)
Automatically localize and classify thoracic abnormalities from chest radiographs. Obtained Bronze medal (Top 9%) from Kaggle Competition.

- ### [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification](https://github.com/ruyiq/Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification)
Identify the type of disease present on a Cassava Leaf image. Obtained Bronze medal (Top 9%) from Kaggle Competition.

- ### UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation
Automatically segment the stomach and intestines on MRI scans. Obtained Bronze medal (Top 8%) from Kaggle Competition.

- ### [The Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Based on ResNet and EfficientNet Model](https://github.com/ruyiq/The-Vehicle-Trajectory-Prediction-Based-on-ResNet-and-EfficientNet-Model#the-vehicle-trajectory-prediction-based-on-resnet-and-efficientnet-model)
Results are published in a EI Conference. The main innovation of this paper is the combination of RESNET network and efficient net network, which not only greatly increases the network depth, but also comprehensively changes the choice of network width and image resolution, so as to make the model performance better, but also save computing resources as much as possible.

## Machine Learning: Natural Language Processing
- ### [Classification Of Fake News Headline Based On Neural Networks](https://github.com/ruyiq/Classification-Of-Fake-News-Headline-Based-On-Neural-Networks)
Results are published in a EI Conference. Obtained a accuracy of 0.8622, which has highest accuracy among previous models.
