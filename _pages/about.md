Hi! I’m Ruyi — a data-driven storyteller, marketing science analyst, and lifelong learner. I use analytics to turn complex data into actionable insights that drive growth, shape strategy, and make a real impact.

I currently work as a Senior Marketing Science Analyst at Knix, where I help optimize campaigns, track customer behavior, and uncover what truly moves the needle. My background spans agency and in-house roles, with experience in attribution, A/B testing, e-commerce analytics, and customer segmentation. I’m also a certified Tableau Desktop Specialist and a two-time Kaggle bronze medalist.

Outside of work, I’m a master’s student at Georgia Tech, an avid reader (50+ books in 2024!), and the proud pet parent of 3 cats and 3 dogs. I’m also passionate about community building — I lead the Toronto chapter of Girls Who Impact, a platform helping Asian women explore impact and sustainability careers.

Whether you’re here to explore my projects, connect over data, or just say hi — welcome! I’m glad you’re here.
