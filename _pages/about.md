Hello! My name is Ruyi Qu and I'm a student at the University of Toronto specializing in Math & Probability and meanwhile majoring in Cognitive Science - Computational Cognition.
I have gained a background in programming languages and software including Python, Java, R, SAS, MySQL, and Tableau as well as in using different libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Besides all, I enjoy reading in my leisure time.
