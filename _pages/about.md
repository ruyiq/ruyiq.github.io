Hello, this is Ruyi Qu.  I graduated from the University of Toronto in Steptember 2022 majoring in both mathematics and cognitive science. Currently, I'm working at Hotspex Media as a Senior Data Analyst. 

I have gained a background in programming languages and software including (but not limited to) C++, Python, Java, R as well as  using different libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 

Besides all, I enjoy reading in my leisure time. You are welcome to contact me and start a conversation if you have a similar interest :)
